"""Owner domains: a proven domain gives its owner the names that begin with it.

A domain is unique, but a deploy body can name any domain, so it counts only once its control
is proven, the way ACME and the MCP Registry prove it — either:

  - DNS:   a TXT record on _hestia.<domain> reading  hestia-owner=<owner public key, base64>
           (read through DNS-over-HTTPS, HESTIA_DOH_URL);
  - HTTPS: https://<domain>/.well-known/hestia-owner.json  =  {"owner_pubkeys": ["<key>", …]}

On proof the hearth claims for that owner, for good (hestia/names.py), the domain as a
namespace, zone included: every family, product and publisher that BEGINS with the domain, in
either order — `attestedmemory.net.claim.weigh`, `net.attestedmemory.claim.weigh`,
`attestedmemory-net.deal`, "Attestedmemory.net Labs" — is the owner's alone, and the domain itself
is its publisher name. The bare word is nobody's: attestedmemory.com, .dev and .net can be three
owners, so `attestedmemory.deal` stays first come, like any name. A name that merely starts with
the same letters (`attestedmemorynetwork.tool`) is held for review as a look-alike.

Only a registrable ASCII domain counts: example.com or example.co.uk, not a subdomain, and not an
IDN (its letters can pass for another script's). The namespace must not cover a name another
holder already uses; the operator settles that (POST /v1/admin/names/release).

The HTTPS proof is fetched from the domain the owner names, so the hearth refuses one that
resolves to anything but public unicast addresses (loopback, RFC 1918, link-local, CGNAT,
documentation and reserved ranges), follows no redirect, and reads at most 16 KiB. What comes
back is only compared with the owner's key; nothing of it is returned to the caller.
